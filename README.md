# VitaminDClinicalStudyReport
Report generated for a local university to provide to the participants in their 3 year study. The script will generate 300 reports for the participants, although I only included data for 3 participants for this repository.

Note: To protect privacy of the participants, the data in this report is not the real data from the study.

The pdf reports are generated using the R program language.

You can download the entire project file. 

To run: 
1. in the 01_Scripts file, you can open the 4_Generate_Reports.R file.
2. On lines 38 and 40, you can toggle the ability to generate one report or all of the reports (this will generate 3).
3. The reports are saved in the 03_Rmarkdown_Reports folder.
